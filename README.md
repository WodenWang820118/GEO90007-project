# City of Melbourne, tourists recommendation website
# Overview
The project gives an overview of the city of Melbourne about the dining options and live music.
The website serves as a prototype to give visitors recommendations, suggestions according to the suburbs.
The website is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

# File structure
The project's structure follows Vue.js's strategy, in which the related CSS file and the javascript file are under the same file.
However, in this project, these files are under the same folder. For example, in the `scripts/header` folder, the related CSS file is `header.css` and the javascript file is `header.js`. Although
the CSS file is not scoped to the specific file, it's relatively simple to find the styles instead of all-in-one `style.css`.  

## Data
The data is stored in JSON format in the javascript file.
