# City of Melbourne, tourists recommendation website
# Overview
The project gives an overview of the city of Melbourne about the dining options and live music.
The website serves as a prototype to give visitors recommendations, suggestions according to the suburbs.
The website is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

# File structure
The project's structure follows Vue.js's strategy, in which the related CSS code and the javascript code are in the same `.vue` extension file (script, style block).
However, in this project, the code is separated into two files situated in the same folder. For example, in the `scripts/header` folder, the related CSS file is `header.css` and the javascript file is `header.js`. Although the CSS file is not scoped to the specific file, it's relatively simple to find the styles instead of all-in-one `style.css`.  

## Data
The data is stored in JSON format in the javascript file.
